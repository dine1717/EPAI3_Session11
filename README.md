# EPAI3_Session12 - Iterables and Iterators -1 


1. The starting point for this project is the Polygon class and the Polygons sequence type we created in the previous project.

2. The code for these classes along with the unit tests for the Polygon class are below if you want to use those as your starting point. But use whatever you came up with in the last project.

# ONLY Goal

1. Refactor the Polygons (sequence) type, into an iterable. You'll need to implement both an iterable, and an iterator.
